    "Jill is poking her head through the door, looking around nervously. When she sees me, she smiles and comes inside."
    jill "Hey Alex!"
    frannie "Hey Jill. Put on an apron and have Alex show you what you need to do."
    jill "Yes ma'am!"
    alex "That’s awesome! You got the job!"
    jill "Yeah, and it’s thanks to you!"
    "I spend the morning showing Jill what to do."
    "She is nervous at the start and drops a few muffins. Though by noon, she handles the register pretty well."

    "The bell rings as someone leaves. As they leave someone else slips in through the open door."
    calvin "Hey Jill!"
    jill "Calvin?"
    calvin "I came to see you on your first day of work!"
    jill "Aww thanks, boo."
    calvin "Wait wait wait, lemme take a picture of you. You look great in that apron."
    jill "Please don’t. I’m covered in flour."
    "I see Calvin take some pictures anyway. They act cutesie, and Calvin has her pose in front of the display case and holding a tray of muffins. It’s grossly adorable."
    alex "Get a room you two."
    calvin "But we’re already in a room."
    "I get out of the way as Jill walks up to him and throws a handful of flour at his head."
    calvin "Hey."
    frannie "Haha. I remember those days, eh Tom?"
    "Tom was already standing behind her with a handful of flour. As soon as she turned around he tossed it in her face."
    frannie "Tom!"
    thomas "Haha."
    "Tom likely didn’t see the tube of icing she was holding behind her back."
    "Soon everyone was covered in flour, icing, and sprinkles-- even me."
    "I’m so glad that Jill enjoyed her first day, and that Frannie and Tom look happier without all the stress from being understaffed."

    "Work was insane. It seemed that the ovens couldn’t cook fast enough and I had to ask people to wait constantly." 
    "By the end of the day, I’m exhausted. I hope Frannie finds someone to help out soon."
    "They also gave me some fresh bread and other baked goods to take home for the trouble."
